- unsync device is a good one 

- Think more about what you want to keep on your computer
- Create things that bring joy 
- Many things have already fulfilled its purpose

- things will still work out, even if you are lacking something. 
- 

- Chrome browser
- Folders and files within my directory
- Resources 
- If these are the tools, for instance, in my npm modules that have actually that's like fucking crazy, dude that you could have been building so many other cool things. 
Description: follow the marie kondon methodology in cleaning folders, function, classes, files in your work, spark complete joy here.

    Then
 
    Given that I want to streamline the process of creating repositories and having the goal of writing things once 
    When I create a module, I want to ensure that it's tested and the documentation is solid. This is like writing  
    Then

    Given that most documentation is available online, and I can always reinstall repositories
    When 
    Then

    Given that I want to marry Cyrus
    When I code
    Then I want to be the best, I want to make him proud. 

    Given that I want to deploy today
    When I have completed the basic structure, I want to ensure that it also has a deploy script (executable scripts)
    Then it will be easy to streamline way of doing things 

    Given that most of code is about precision
    When I 
    Then I will be quicker in development 

    Given that I code much better when I sleep more 
    When I sit down for the day to complete things, or want to do something
    Then it will be clear as to what I need to do for the day. 

    Given that I have learned to trust myself more in the past year 
    When I look through the directory structure today
    Then I should trust myself more in terms of what I need
